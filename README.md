# Capstone_3
Flight Data Analysis

For a basic summary of the conclusions of this project, refer to the Capstone 3 Documentation File

If interested in reviewing the actual code, preprocessing work (cleaning data and uploading to Snowflake) is done in Flight Data Processing. Analytical work is done in Flight_analytics.

Some processing work was done in DBT, so the DBT documentation is included as well.
